## Sample Datasets
This presents two sample datasets which are reported on the Scientific data in 2020 [[ref](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00634-8)].  Each dataset contains the experimental optical property of organic molecules measured in various solvents.


These datasets were preprocessed from previously reported data by retaining only neutral molecules with molecular weights below 480.
